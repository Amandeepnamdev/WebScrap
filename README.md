# WebScrap
Problem Statement:  Our Sourcing team needs to get a list of companies working on specific domains (web development, mobile app development, react, etc.). But the manual lookup for the same becomes tedious and time-consuming. If they are provided with CSV/excel files of the firms with all the details, it may help them save a significant amount of time. For that, we need you to write a python script that can scrape data from this website
(https://clutch.co).
The sample CSV of scraped data:

Web Scraping for Clutch Website using python.

I have made this using Python and Beautiful Soup.

Here,result.csv is taken for only some pages for simplicity. If you want all results then You have to run webscrap.py file.
I have made a column "Domain" Which is specifying Domain of company like - Web-development,mobile app development.

All Columns - ['Company','Business Entity Name' ,'Domain','Website','Location','Contact','Rating',
    'Review Count','Hourly Rate','Min Project Size','Employee Size',
    'Founded Year','Status','Bank Ruptcy Status','Tagline','Verification']
