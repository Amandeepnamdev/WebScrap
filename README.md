# WebScrap
Web Scraping for Clutch Website using python.
I have made this using Python and Beautiful Soup.

Here,result.csv is taken for only some pages for simplicity. If you want all results then You have to run webscrap.py file.
I have made a column "Domain" Which is specifying Domain of company like - Web-development,mobile app development.
All Columns - ['Company','Business Entity Name' ,'Domain','Website','Location','Contact','Rating',
    'Review Count','Hourly Rate','Min Project Size','Employee Size',
    'Founded Year','Status','Bank Ruptcy Status','Tagline','Verification']
